# Tissue Homogenization

## Equipment

* Homogenizer
    * VWR® 200 Homogenizer

* Ice Bucket

## Reagents

* MilliQ $H_2O$
   * Fill two 15-mL tubes with 13-14 mL water.

* Methanol
    * Fill one 15-mL tube with 13-14 mL methanol.

* Lysis Buffer
    * Normally we use 8 M Urea for this step. See the [Cell Lysis](lysis.md)
      protocol for the steps of how to prepare this solution.

## Steps

1. Prepare the homogenizer.
    1. Immerse the probe in first tube of water.
    2. Turn on the homogenizer for 5 minutes.
    3. Repeat for tube of methanol and second tube of water.
        * Do not use methanol wash until there are clearly no tissue pieces
          in the tip. Otherwise the methanol will fix them and make them harder
          to remove.
2. Add 3 mL lysis buffer to 15 mL tube on ice.
3. Grab a timer.
4. Get sample from -80 °C freezer, keep on dry ice.
5. Take tissue out of tube using tweezers and deposit on a weighing tray that
   has been tared.
6. Record weight, size, and shape of tissue sample.
7. Quickly transfer sample to tube with lysis buffer.
8. Start the homogenization procedure.
    1. 6 pulses of 10 seconds, separated by 10 second intervals to let probe
       cool down.
    2. Check tube for visible chunks of tissue, apply additional 10 second
       pulses as needed.
9. Take a 50 μL aliquot for [BCA](bca.md) protein quantification.
10. Place aliquot and full lysate on dry ice, transfer full lysate to -80 °C
    freezer.
11. Centrifuge lysate aliquot down at 4000 rpm, 4 °C for 5 minutes prior to
    BCA assay.
12. Centrifuge full lysate down at 4000 rpm, 4 °C for 20 minutes prior to
    reduction, alkylation, and digestion steps.
