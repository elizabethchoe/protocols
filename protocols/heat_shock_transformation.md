# Transformation of Bacteria Using Heat Shock

Taken from MFT, 11/21/03.

## Equipment

* 37 °C shaking incubator
    * Located down the hallway between the Yaffe and Hynes labs.

* 37 °C plate incubator
    * Located down the hallway by Yaffe Lab.

* Heat Block / Water Bath
    * Pre-heat to 42 °C.

## Reagents

* LB Broth
    * 20 g / L of LB, autoclaved, no antibiotics.

* Competent E. coli cells
    * Use DH5α in most cases.
        * Located in -80 °C.
    * If you want to cut at XbaI or other DAM- enzyme sites, use SCS110 cell
      which are deficient in Dam and Dcm methylases.

* LB plates
    * Add the correct antibiotic, usually Ampicillin or Kanamycin depending on
      the plasmid.

* Falcon Round-Bottom Polystyrene Tubes
    * Located in stock room or under Vibhuti's bench.

## Steps

1. Day 1
    1. Take cells out of freezer, keep on ice.
    2. Turn on water bath to 42 °C.
    3. Put competent cells in a 1.5 mL tube.
        * Use 50 μL for a DNA construct.
        * Use 100 μL for a ligation.
        * You may need more or less cells, depending on how competent they
          are.
    4. Keep tubes on ice for 5 minutes.
    5. Add 50 ng (2 μL) of circular DNA into E. coli cells.
    6. Incubate on ice for 10 minutes to thaw competent cells.
    7. Put tubes with DNA and E. coli into water bath at 42 °C for 45 seconds.
        * Make sure to be exact with your timing, too long or too short will
          ruin the transformation.
    8. Put tubes back on ice for 2 minutes to reduce damage to cells.
    9. Add 1 mL of LB to cells.
    10. Incubate tubes for 1 hour at 37 °C with shaking.
        * Can incubate for 30 minutes for plasmid transformation. Ligation is
          more sensitive and will need an hour.
    11. Spread about 100 μL of the resulting culture on LB plates.
    12. Grow overnight in 37 °C.
2. Day 2
    1. Pick colonies about 12-16 hours after plating.
        * To pick a colony, stab a single isolated disk of bacteria with a
          clean filtered pipette tip.
        * Plates can be stored in cold room, wrapped in parafilm for later
          colony picking.
    2. Eject pipette tip into tube containing LB media and any required
       antibiotics.
        * Use Round-Bottom Polystyrene tubes.
        * Use 5 mL media for mini-prep, 100 mL for midi-prep
    3. Let cells grow overnight at 37 °C with shaking.
3. Day 3
    1. Take cells out of incubator and move to benchtop.
    2. Make 50-50 stocks of cells and glycerol in cell storage tubes.
    3. Store cell stocks at -80 °C.
    4. Follow Qiagen's mini-/midi-prep protocol to isolate plasmids from cells.
    5. Check plasmid concentration using nanodrop.
        * For mini, you want in the range of 200-500 ng / μL of DNA.
    6. Make 800 ng / 10 μL aliquots of plasmid in water and send for sequencing.
        * Ask a lab member on how to get set up with GeneWiz.
    7. Store plasmids at -20 °C.
