# Transformation of Bacteria Using Heat Shock

Taken from MFT, 11/21/03.

## Equipment

* 37 °C incubator
    * Located down the hallway by Yaffe Lab.

* Heat Block / Water Bath
    * Pre-heat to 42 °C.

## Reagents

* LB Broth
    * 20 g / L of LB, autoclaved, no antibiotics.

* Competent E. coli cells
    * Use DH5α in most cases.
        * Located in -80 °C.
    * If you want to cut at XbaI or other DAM- enzyme sites, use SCS110 cell
      which are deficient in Dam and Dcm methylases.

* LB plates
    * Add the correct antibiotic, usually Ampicillin or Kanamycin depending on
      the plasmid.

## Steps

1. Take cells out of freezer, keep on ice.
2. Turn on water bath to 42 °C.
3. Put competent cells in a 1.5 mL tube.
    * Use 50 μL for a DNA construct.
    * Use 100 μL for a ligation.
    * You may need more or less cells, depending on how competent they are.
4. Keep tubes on ice for 5 minutes.
5. Add 50 ng (2 μL) of circular DNA into E. coli cells.
6. Incubate on ice for 10 minutes to thaw competent cells.
7. Put tubes with DNA and E. coli into water bath at 42 °C for 45 seconds.
    * Make sure to be exact with your timing, too long or too short will ruin
      the transformation.
8. Put tubes back on ice for 2 minutes to reduce damge to cells.
9. Add 1 mL of LB to cells.
10. Incubate tubes for 1 hour at 37 °C.
    * Can incubate for 30 minutes for plasmid transformation. Ligation is more
      sensitive and will need an hour.
11. Spread about 100 μL of the resulting culture on LB plates.
12. Grow overnight.
13. Pick colonies about 12-16 hours later.
