# New TMT Aliquot Protocol

## Equipment & Reagents

* Speed-Vac
* Anhydrous Acetonitrile (use the newest/freshest one)
    * Located in flammables cabinet under wet lab fume hood.

## Steps

1. Each vial contains 5 mg label. Each labeling reaction requires 250 μg label,
   so each vial contains 10 aliquots with each aliquot enough label for 2 runs.
2. Resuspend 5 mg label in 305 μL anhydrous acetonitrile. Vortex and spin /
   shake down.
3. Aliquot into 10 x 30 μL aliquots. Save leftovers (~5 μL).
4. Speed-vac to dryness (1-2 hours) and store at -80°C in freezer box filled
   with dessicant (below plate reader). Place box in freezer bag with dessicant
   packs from kit.
5. Mark lot # and date on sheet or -80°C freezer.
6. Save vial labels and keep in TMT binder (Located in writing lab).

Additional notes:
- When labeling, always label at least two runs at a time to avoid freeze-thaw cycles
