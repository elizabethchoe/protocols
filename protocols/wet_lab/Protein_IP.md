# Protein Immunoprecipitation

## Equipment & Reagents

* Thermo-controlled Centrifuge
* Ice bucket / tray
* Heat block
* RIPA Buffer (see [RIPA Lysis](RIPA_Lysis.md))
* Protein A / G agarose beads
    * See [Antibody Affinities](https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/selection-charts/affinity-of-protein-ag-for-igg-types-from-different-species)
    * Use protein A for rabbit and protein G for mouse.
* Antibody to target of interest
* Laemmli sample buffer
    * 20% Glycerol
    * 4.6% SDS
    * 125 mM Tris, pH 6.8
    * 0.05% Bromophenol blue
    * Full recipe for 100 mL bottle:
        * 20 mL 100% Glyercol
        * 46 mL 10% SDS
        * 16.66 mL 0.75 M Tris pH 6.8
        * 5 mL 1% Bromophenol blue
        * Bring up to 100 mL with MilliQ Water
        * Store at room temperature
    * Add β-mercaptoethanol to 10% just before use

## Steps

1. Remove lysates from -80°C and keep on ice.
2. Pre-clear lysates by centrifuging at 13,400 rpm, 4°C for 15 minutes.
    * Do this immediately after removing lysates from freezer, they will thaw
      while centrifuging.
3. Remove pellet or transfer supernatant to new tube.
4. Perform a protein BCA assay to calculate loading inputs.
5. Add antibody to 500 μg of protein, bring volume to 500 μL in lysis buffer.
    * Amount of antibody will depend on antibody used, check spec sheet.
    * If not on spec sheet, use 1:100 (i.e. 5 μg Ab / 500 μg lysate)
6. Incubate at 4°C on rotator overnight.
7. Add 40 μL protein A / G agarose beads to each tube.
8. Incubate for at least 1 hour at 4°C on rotator.
9. Centrifuge samples at 4°C for 2-5 minutes at 10,000 rpm.
10. Remove (and optionally save) supernatant.
11. Wash beads 3x with 1 mL cold RIPA.
12. Add 20 μL 2x Laemmli sample buffer after third wash.
    * If running in duplicate, add 40 μL and load 20 μL for each well.
    * Calculate the correct amount of sample buffer that is needed, then at
      β-mercaptoethanol to 10% just before use.
13. Heat the samples at 95°C for 5 minutes.
14. Centrifuge samples at 13,400 rpm for 1 minute at room temperature.
15. Load gel, be careful to avoid pipetting agarose beads.
    * Alternatively, for storage, transfer supernatants to new tube and store at
      -20°C. Samples must be re-heated (5 minutes at 95°C) before loading.
