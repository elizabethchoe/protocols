# Trizol-Qiagen Extraction of RNA from Human Cells

## Equipment & Reagents

* Trizol
    * Located in wet lab fridge, top shelf.
* Chloroform
    * Located in flammables cabinet under fume hood in wet lab.
* Absolute, 100% Ethanol
* Qiagen RNeasy mini column
* Buffer RPE
* DEPC Water
    * Ultrapure, RNase-free.

## Steps

1. Spin down 1 x 10^7 - 1 x 10^8 cells and aspirate the supernatant.
2. Add 1 mL TRIZOL to cell pellet and resuspend vigorously. Pipet into 1.5 mL
   Eppendorf tube.
    * The lysate can be held at -80°C indefinitely at this point. When thawing,
      let lysate sit completely at room temperature, vortex for 15 - 20 seconds,
      and continue.
3. Add 200 μL chloroform to the lysate.
4. Close cap and vortex thoroughly for at least 1 minute.
5. Let the mix settle at room temperature for 2 minutes.
6. Centrifuge at 4°C, maximum speed (13.4 krpm), for 20 minutes.
    * Use centrifuge in cold room.
7. The mix should now have a very clearly defined aqueous (clear, upper) layer
   and an organic (pink, lower) layer. Carefully remove the aqueous layer into
   a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.
8. Add an equal volume of absolute, 100% Ethanol.
9. Mix gently with pipet.
10. Add 700 μL of the mix to a Qiagen RNeasy mini column.
11. Spin at max speed for 30 seconds and remove the flow-through to a separate
    waste container.
12. Add the remaining mix to the same column and re-spin, same speed, and remove
    the flow-through.
13. Wash the column with 500 μL Buffer RPE (1 minute, max speed)
14. Wash a second time with 500 μL Buffer RPE (1 minute, max speed). Remove
    flow-through and move pink column into a new collection tube.
15. Add 30-50 μL of DEPC water to the column, aiming for the middle of the white
    filter. Let sit for 1 minute, then spin at max speed for 1 minute.
    Collect the flow-through as RNA and store at -80°C.
16. [Check RNA concentration](rna_concentration.md).
