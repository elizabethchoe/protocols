## Steps

1. Concentrate antibody of interest ensuring concentration ~2mg/mL or higher.
    * NOTE: Antibodies must be prepared in an amine-free buffer without carrier
      proteins (i.e. free of TBS, sodium azide, BSA, gelatin, etc.) to avoid
      interference with conjugation.
    1. For each conjugation (i.e. anti-mouse IgG with PLUS oligo), concentrate
       100 μL of antibody to 50 μL using Amicon filters.
    2. Pre-rinse filter twice with Wash Buffer and leave last rinse in filter
       until ready for antibody... DO NOT LET FILTER DRY OUT.
    3. Add sample and place filter in a collection tube and spin 6 minutes at
       14,000 rpm (4°C).
    4. Invert filter in new collection tube and spin 2 minutes at 1,200 rpm
       (4°C) to recover. Top up to 50 μL final volume with filtrate if
       necessary.
2. Dissolve 1mg (1 vial) S-HyNic to 10mM with 344.5 μL DMSO.
    * NOTE: Prepare fresh and use immediately. Do not store the dissolved
      S-HyNic solution, as S-HyNic will hydrolyze quickly.
3. Add 1.87 μL S-HyNic to 50 μL of antibody and incubate 2 hours at room
   temperature on rotor.
4. Remove unreacted S-HyNic from the S-HyNic-antibody mixture by purifying the
   modified antibody through Zeba desalting columns.
    * NOTE: The buffer of the spin columns should be replaced with conjugation
      buffer (i.e. 200 μL conjugation buffer exchanged three times) before
      purification, according to the manufacturerʼs instructions.
    1. Add sample to column, place in new collection tube and spin 2 minutes at
       1,200 rpm (4°C).
5. Resuspend lyophilized aldehyde-modified oligos to 1 μg / μL with Ultrapure
   water.
6. Prepare 1 M aniline stock by diluting 93.13 μL aniline into 1 mL methanol.
    * NOTE: Prepare fresh and use immediately. Do not store the diluted aniline
      solution, as aniline will oxidize quickly and is light-sensitive.
7. Combine 22.1 μL aldehyde-modified oligonucleotide with 50 μL of the modified
   antibody. To increase the conjugation efficiency, include 0.73 μL aniline in
   the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 10 mM.
   * NOTE: For two proximity probes to be used in the same PLA reaction, they
     must have different oligonucleotide types (ie. anti-mouse PLUS oligo with
     anti-rabbit MINUS oligo). Proximity probes with the same type of
     oligonucleotide (eg. both having oligonucleotide type PLUS) cannot be used
     together.
8. Incubate the oligonucleotide-modified antibody mixture overnight at 4°C.
9. Buffer exchange the oligo-conjugated antibodies with the Amicon filters to
   reduce the amount of unreacted oligos.
    1. Add sample to pre-wet filter (see step 1b), place in collection tube and
       spin 6 minutes at 14,000 rpm (4°C).
    2. Add 70 μL conjugation buffer to the sample place in collection tube and
       spin 8 minutes at 14,000 rpm (4°C). REPEAT.
    3. Invert filter in new collection tube and spin 2 minutes at 1,200 rpm
       (4°C) to recover... top up to 50 μL final volume with conjugation
       buffer if necessary.
10. Store secondary proximity probes at 4°C for use.
11. OPTIONAL: For higher purity, remove unreacted oligonucleotides by purifying
    the proximity probe using gel filtration by HPLC on a Superdex-75 or
    Superdex-100 column.

* NOTE: The appropriate working dilution of each batch of secondary probes can
  be determined by serial dilution in a positive control PLA assay. Generally,
  the working range is 1:500-1:1500.
