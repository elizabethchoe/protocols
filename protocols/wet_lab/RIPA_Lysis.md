# RIPA Cell Lysis for Immunoblotting / Protein IP

## Equipment & Reagents

* Ice Bucket / Ice Tray
* Pipetman
* Aspirator
* RIPA Lysis Buffer
    * 150 mM NaCl
    * 50 mM Tris, pH7.4
    * 1% Deoxycholate
    * 1% Triton X100
    * 5 mM EDTA
    * Full recipe for 250 mL bottle:
        * 7.5 mL 5 M NaCl
        * 15.5 mL 1 M Tris, pH 7.4
        * 25 mL 10% DOC
        * 25 mL 10% Triton X100
        * 5 mL 500 mM EDTA
        * Bring up to 250 mL with MilliQ Water, store at 4°C
* Halt: Protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
    * Pierce cat. no. 78426
* 1X PBS, non-sterile
    * Keep on ice
* Cell Scrapers
* Labeled 15-mL tubes

## Steps

1. Fill ice bucket / tray with ice.
2. Make RIPA + Halt at 100:1 ratio.
    * 50 μL Halt to 5 mL RIPA
    * 250 μL RIPA per 10 cm dish
3. Place cell plates on ice tray.
4. Aspirate media from plates.
5. Wash cells twice with ice cold PBS.
    * Aspirate off as much PBS as possible: tilt plate on ice and remove PBS.
6. Lyse cells.
7. Use cell scraper to lift cells off the plate.
    * Keep plate tilted and allow lysis buffer to pool at the bottom.
8. Transfer lysate to labeled tube.
9. Store lysates in the -80°C freezer.
