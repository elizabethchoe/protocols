# cDNA Preparation

## Reagents

* DEPC Water

* DNAse buffer (10X)

* DNAse
    * Invitrogen 18068-015

* 25 mM EDTA
    * Inviotrogen P/N Y02353

* iScript Master Mix

* Reverse Transcriptase (RT) Enzyme

## Steps

1. Measure out 1 μg of RNA and bring to 9 μL total volume with DEPC water.
    * Remember to prep two tubes for +/- RT control.
2. Add 1 μL of 10X DNAse buffer and 1 μL of DNAse
3. Incubate at RT for 15 minutes.
4. Add 1 μL of EDTA and incubate at 65 °C in water bath for 10 minutes.
5. Cool for 1 minute at RT and then spin down the RNA until the rotor reaches
   10-12,000 rpm.
6. Add 8 μL of the appropriate master mix to the RNA samples and incubate at
   37°C for 2 hours (Preferably use a RT sequence on a thermocycler).
7. Quick spin and store at -20°C until ready for qPCR.
