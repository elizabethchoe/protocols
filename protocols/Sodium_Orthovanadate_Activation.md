# Sodium Orthovanadate Activation

Sodium orthovanadate should be activated for maximal inhibition of protein
phosphotyrosyl-phosphatases.

This procedure depolymerizes the vanadate, converting it into a more potent
inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Please note that DTT rapidly
inactivates sodium orthovanadate.

## Equipment & Reagents

* Water bath
* 200 mM Sodium Orthovanadate
* 1 N NaOH
* 1 N HCl

## Steps

1. Prepare solution of 200 mM sodium orthovanadate.
2. Adjust the pH to 10.0 using NaOh or HCl. The starting pH of the solution
   many vary across different lots of the chemical.
    * At pH 10.0 the solution will be yellow.
3. Boil the solution until it turns colorless (approx. 10 minutes).
4. Cool the solution to room temperature.
5. Readjust the pH to 10.0 and repeat steps 3-4 until the solution remains
   colorless and the pH stabilizes at 10.0.
6. Store the activated solution as aliquots at -20Â°C.
