## Equipment & Reagents

* Magnetic Rack
* Sera-Mag Speed Beads A
    * Thermo Scientific; CAT No. 09-981-121, Magnetic Carboxylate Modified
* Sera-Mag Speed Beads B
    * Thermo Scientific; CAT No. 09-981-123, Magnetic Carboxylate Modified

## Bead Preparation Steps

1. To prepare beads, remove from fridge and keep at room temperature for 10
   minutes.
2. Combine 20 µL of Sera-Mag A and 20 µL of Sera-Mag B.
3. Add 160 µL of water.
4. Place PCR tube with beads on a magnetic rack and let beads settle for 2
   minutes. Once beads have settled, remove and discard supernatant.
5. Rinse beads with 200 µL of water by pipette mixing (off the magnetic stand).
   Repeat this rinse two further times.
6. Store beads in 100 µL of water in the fridge. Never freeze the beads.
7. Use 2µL of bead-mix per sample (enough beads for 50 samples); make sure the
   beads are well resuspended in the solution (vortex). Prepared beads can be
   stored at 4°C indefinitely.

## SP3 Protein Clean-up

The steps described here are based on the use of 10 µL of lysate from the
cell preparation protocol that already contains the required 2µL of prepared
beads. If you are using a mixture that does not already contain beads, add an
appropriate amount (e.g. 20 µg or 2 µL from the 10 µg/µL stock) directly to the
mixture.

1. Add 5 µL of 1% formic acid to the protein lysate and check that the mixture
   is acidic.
2. Immediately add acetonitrile to obtain a final percentage of 50% (15 µL of a
   100% stock). Alternate Protocol: a pre-made mix of formic acid and
   acetonitrile can be used and added as a single step.
3. Incubate for 8 minutes at room temperature off the rack.
4. Place on magnetic rack and incubate for further 2 minutes at room
   temperature.
5. Remove and discard supernatant.
6. Add 200 µL of 70% ethanol and incubate for 30 seconds on the magnetic stand.
   Remove and discard supernatant.
7. Add 200 µL of 70% ethanol and incubate for 30 seconds on the magnetic stand.
   Remove and discard supernatant.
8. Add 180 µL of acetonitrile and incubate for 15 seconds on the magnetic stand.
   Remove and discard supernatant and air-dry the beads for 30 seconds.
9. Reconstitute beads in water (or desired buffer of choice). For digestion,
   reconstitute beads in 5 µL of digestion solution (e.g. 50 mM HEPES pH
   8.0 + Xµg of trypsin/lysC mix (1:25 enzyme to substrate ratio)). It is not
   necessary to completely homogenize the beads, as they will be stuck
   to each other and excessive handling will generate bubbles. The
   cluster will break down as proteins are digested.
10. Incubate for 14 hours at 37 °C.

Digested peptides can be recovered from the beads by placing the tube on a
magnetic rack and removing the supernatant containing them. The peptide
mixture can be used directly in downstream fractionation, labeling, or
conventional clean-up workflows. The beads can be sonicated to improve
recovery of the peptides.

## SP3 Peptide Clean-up

This protocol is based on the use of 5 µL of protein digest that already
contains beads. If you are using a digest that does not already contain
beads, add an appropriate amount (e.g. 20 µg or 2 µL from the 10 µg/µL
stock) directly to the peptide mixture.

1. Resuspend beads after digestion by pipetting.
2. Add acetonitrile to each sample to obtain a final percentage of 95% or
   higher and pipette mix. Incubate for 8 minutes at room temperature.
3. Place on magnetic rack for a further 2 minutes.
4. Remove and discard supernatant.
5. Add 180 µL of acetonitrile and incubate for 15 seconds on the magnetic
   stand. Remove and discard supernatant.
6. Reconstitute beads in desired volume of 2% DMSO (in water, not
   acidic) (ex. 9 µL). Optional: sonicate the reconstituted beads for 1
   minute to improve recovery.
7. Give the tube a quick spin (~2 seconds) in a bench-top PCR-tube
   centrifuge to aid the liquid removal from the tube walls.
8. Place tubes on a magnetic rack and recover supernatant making sure
   to not recover any beads. Optional: To eliminate any potential bead
   carryover, it is recommended that the removed liquid be transferred to
   a fresh PCR tube, placed on the magnetic rack, and recovered a
   second time with a fresh pipette tip.
9. Place supernatant in a deactivated glass vial containing 1% formic acid
   (ex. 1 µL).
10. Mix by pipetting and centrifuge for 30 seconds at 5,000 g.
    Recovered samples can be directly injected to mass spectrometer
    hardware without prior treatment. Samples can be stored at -20°C
    prior to, and after acidification.
