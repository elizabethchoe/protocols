# Silver Stain

Silver stains allow you to visual total protein content in a gel.

## Equipment & Reagents

* Aspirator
    * Use separate trap for silver stain solution.
* Piece Silver Stain for MS (cat. no. 24600)
* Fixing Solution
    * 60% MilliQ Water
    * 30% Ethanol
    * 10% Acetic Acid
* Stop Solution
    * 95% MilliQ Water
    * 5% Acetic Acid
* Ethanol Wash
    * 90% MilliQ Water
    * 10% Ethanol
* Ultrapure Water

## Steps

1. Wash gel 2x in ultrapure water for 5 minutes.
    * For all wash steps: Add solution, wait a period of time, then decant
      solution into waste storage container. Repeat as specified in each step.
3. Wash gel 2x in Fixing Solution for 15 minutes.
    * Gel may remain in fixing solution overnight without affecting stain
      performance.
4. Wash gel 2x in Ethanol Wash for 5 minutes.
5. Wash gel 2x in ultrapure water.
6. Prepare sensitizer working solution by mixing 1 part Silver Stain Sensitizer
   with 500 parts ultrapure water (i.e. 30 μL sensitizer with 15 mL water).
7. Incubate gel in sensitizer working solution for exactly 1 minute.
8. Wash gel 2x in ultrapure water for 1 minute.
9. Mix 1 part Silver Stain Enhancer with 100 parts Silver Stain (i.e. 150 μL
   Sensitizer with 15 mL stain).
10. Immediately add mix to gel, incubate for 5 minutes.
11. Prepare developer working solution by mixing 1 part Silver Stain Enhancer
    with 100 parts Silver Stain Developer (i.e. 150 μL enhancer with 15 mL
    developer).
12. Wash gel 2x with ultrapure water for 20 seconds.
13. Immediately add developer working solution and incubate until protein bands
    appear (2 - 3 minutes).
14. When the desired band intensity is reached, replace developer working
    solution with Stop Solution.
15. Wash gel briefly, then replace with acetic acid and incubate for 10 minutes.
16. Immediately proceed to excising and detaining the gel pieces procedure as
    needed.
