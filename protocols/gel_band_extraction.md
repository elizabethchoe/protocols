# Gel Band Extraction (for MS analysis)

Protocol for in-gel digestion of Coomassie or silver stained gels. This protocol
can be  adapted for other enzymes by changing the digestion buffer / pH
according to the enzyme.


## Equipment

* Speed-Vac

* Vortexer
    * Destaining, rinsing, washing, and dehydration steps should take place
      with the tube shaking on a vortexer at a speed of 2-3.

## Reagents

* Basic Buffer
    * Either 100 mM Ammonium Acetate (pH 8.9) or
      100 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate (pH ~ 8)

* 40% Ethanol (EtOH), 10% Acetic Acid (AA)
    * Used to destain Coommassie

* 20 mM DTT
    * 0.031 g DTT into 1 mL buffer, then dilute 1:10 to get 20 mM DTT

* 60 mM Iodoacetamide (IAA)
    * 0.111 g IAA into 1 mL buffer, then dilute 1:10 to get 60 mM IAA

* 100% Acetonitrile (MeCN)

* Trypsin
    * 12.5 ng / μL
    * Add 1550 μL Basic Buffer to 50 μL (Promega) Trypsin to get 12.5 ng / μL

* 50% Acetonitrile (MeCN), 5% Formic Acid (FA)

* 0.1% Acetic Acid (AA)

## Steps

1. Day 1
    1. Cut out gel band(s), dice into 1 cubic mm pieces, collect in
       microcentrifuge tube.
        * Use new razor band, and a glass plate cleaned with methanol.
    2. If Coommassie stained, destain with 40% EtOH, 10% AA for 1 hour.
    3. Remove destain solution.
    4. Wash with 70 μL of Basic Buffer, shake for 5 minutes.
    5. Remove wash buffer.
    6. Dehydrate gel pieces in speed-vac for 15 minutes.
    7. Add 100 μL of 20 mM DTT.
    8. Incubate at 56°C for 1 hour.
    9. Cool samples to room temperature, spin down, and remove DTT solution.
    10. Add 70 μL IAA, place in dark at room temperature for 45 minutes.
    11. Remove IAA.
    12. Wash with 100 μL Basic Buffer, shake for 5 minutes.
    13. Remove wash buffer.
    14. Dehydrate with 100 μL 100% MeCN, shake for 5 minutes.
    15. Remove MeCN.
    16. Speed-vac for 10 minutes.
        * Dried samples can be stored at 4°C until digestion begins.
    17. Add 50 μL trypsin.
    18. Incubate on ice for 45 minutes.
    19. Remove supernatant.
    20. Add Basic Buffer, incubate overnight at room temperature.

2. Day 2
    1. Collect all supernatants from this point forward in a single tube.
    2. Repeat twice:
        1. Add 15 μL Basic Buffer, shake for 5 minutes.
        2. Collect supernatant.
        3. Dehydrate with 30 μL 50% MeCN, 5% FA, shake for 15 minutes.
        4. Collect supernatant.
    3. Repeat Twice:
        1. Add 15 μL Basic Buffer, shake for 5 minutes.
        2. Dehydrate with 45 μL 100% MeCN, shake for 15 minutes.
        3. Collect supernantant.
    4. Speed-vac until 1-5 μL remains (1 - 2 hours).
    5. Store at -20°C until ready for MS analysis.
    6. Add 30 μL 0.1% AA just before MS analysis.
    7. Load directly onto an acidified pre-column.
