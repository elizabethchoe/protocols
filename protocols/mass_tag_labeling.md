# TMT / iTRAQ Mass Tag Labeling

## Equipment

* Vortexer

* Centrifuge

## Reagents

* TMT
    * Located in -80°C storage in bottom half of Thermo freezer.
    * Ask lab members for card to access freezer.

* Ethanol (200 proof blue jug)
    * Located in flammables cabinet.
    * Used for 4-plex iTRAQ and 6- and 10-plex TMT.

* Isopropanol (200 proof)
    * Used for 8-plex iTRAQ.

* 500 mM TE AB (iTRAQ Dissolution Buffer)
    * Can be made from 1:1 1 M TEAB (located in liquid chemicals shelf) and
      MilliQ water.

* 25% Acetonitrile, 0.1% Acetic Acid

* Anhydrous MeCN
    * Located in flammables cabinet under wet lab hood.

## Steps

1. Spin down lyophilized samples.
2. Resuspend 400 μg dry aliquots in 70 μL Ethanol and 30 μL 500 mM TE AB.
    * Samples may be light pink at this stage.
3. Vortex and spin down at 13,400 rpm for 1 minute..
4. Equilibrate TMT at room temperature for 3 minutes.
5. Resuspend TMT in 30 μL anhydrous MeCN.
6. Vortex and spin down at 13,400 rpm for 1 minute.
7. Add TMT reagent to peptides.
8. Vortex and spin down at 13,400 rpm for 1 minute.
9. Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature.
    * Incubate 8-plex iTRAQ samples for 2 hours
10. Speed-vac samples for 15 - 30 minutes.
    * Check on samples at 15 minutes, want down to volume that all channels can
      be combined in 1.5 mL screw cap tube.
11. Combine samples in 1.5 mL screw cap tube.
    * Use the same pipette tip for all transfers here to avoid losing peptides
      due to contact with new surfaces.
12. Wash tubes with 40 μL 25% Acetonitrile, 0.1% Acetic Acid to remove
    remaining sample and add to combined tubed.
    1. Add mixture.
    2. Vortex for 1 minute.
    3. Spin down for 1 minute at 13,400 rpm.
    4. Transfer to combined tube using the same pipette tip as before
    5. Repeat 3 times.
13. Speed-vac sample to dryness for 6 - 8 hours or overnight.
    * Samples should pale yellow.
14. Store combined sample in -80°C.
