# New TMT / iTRAQ Mass Tag Labeling (use less TMT per reaction!)

## Equipment

* Vortexer

* Centrifuge

## Reagents

* TMT
    * Located in -80°C storage in bottom half of Thermo freezer.
    * Ask lab members for card to access freezer.

* 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5) in HPLC grade water

* 5% Hydroxylammine
    * Located on Jacqueline's shelve in wet lab as 50%, dilute 10x in MQ water

* 25% Acetonitrile, 0.1% Acetic Acid

* Anhydrous MeCN (freshest one)
    * Located in flammables cabinet under wet lab hood.

## Steps

1. Spin down lyophilized samples (after SEPPAK amount of peptide should be between 150-200ug per sample).
2. Resuspend dry aliquots in 35 μL 50mM HEPES in HPLC water.
    * Samples may be light pink at this stage.
3. Vortex and spin down at 13,400 rpm for 1 minute..
4. Equilibrate TMT at room temperature for 3 minutes.
5. Resuspend TMT in 32 μL anhydrous MeCN (enough for 2 labeling reactions!).
6. Vortex and spin down at 13,400 rpm for 1 minute.
7. Add TMT reagent to peptides (15 ul per reaction!).
8. Vortex and spin down at 13,400 rpm for 1 minute.
9. Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature on shaker in wet lab at 400 rpm.
    * Incubate 8-plex iTRAQ samples for 2 hours
10. Add 3.2 ul 5% hydroxylamine per 50 ul reaction. Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature on shaker in wet lab at 400rpm.
11. Combine samples in 1.5 mL screw cap tube.
    * Use the same pipette tip for all transfers here to avoid losing peptides
      due to contact with new surfaces.
12. Wash tubes with 40 μL 25% Acetonitrile, 0.1% Acetic Acid to remove
    remaining sample and add to combined tubed.
    1. Add mixture.
    2. Vortex for 5-10 seconds.
    3. Spin down for 1 minute at 13,400 rpm.
    4. Transfer to combined tube using the same pipette tip as before
    5. Repeat 2 times.
13. Speed-vac sample to dryness for 6 - 8 hours or overnight.
    * Samples should be pale yellow and look fluffy.
14. Store combined sample in -80°C.

Note:
- For IP afterwards, samples resuspend very easily, and need hardly any PH adjustment. So measure before adding base.
