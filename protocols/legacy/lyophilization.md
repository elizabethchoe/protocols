# Lyophilization

## Instruments

* Lyophilizer
    * Located in MS lab.

## Reagents

* Liquid Nitrogen
    * Take from low pressure tank in room across from tissue culture.

## Steps

1. Immerse the tubes in liquid nitrogen for several minutes to reduce sample
   temperature.
2. Loosen the caps on the tubes such that they are not on tight but cannot be
   pulled directly off.
3. Place tubes in lyophilizing chambers (round bottom glass cylinder).
4. Close valves on any other chambers before opening any new valves.
5. Attach the chamber to the the lyophilizer.
6. Ensure the pressure on the lyophilizer drops to below 400 millitorr.
7. Check back on the samples after 30 minutes to ensure they have not melted.
8. Let samples lyophilize overnight.
9. Store the samples at -80Â°C.
