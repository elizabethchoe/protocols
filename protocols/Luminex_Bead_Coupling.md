# Luminex Bead Coupling Protocol

## Equipment & Reagents

Reagent locations written with respect to the Lauffenburger lab.

* Activation Buffer (100mM HaH2PO4, pH 6.3) (yellow rack, AZ bench)
* Coupling Buffer (50mM HEPES, pH 7.4) (yellow rack, AZ bench)
* PBS
* PBS / 1% BSA
* EDC (Sarah -20°C, purple Eppendorfs)
* S-NHS (Far left fridge)
* 100 μL magnetic beads (light sensitive)

## Steps

1. Turn off lights in room due to light sensitivity of reagents.
2. Vortex 100 μL aliquot of bead stock suspension to yield a homogeneous bead
   suspension.
3. Centrifuge the 100 μL bead suspension for 3 minutes at 10,000 g.
4. Discard supernatant.
5. Dissolve 2 mg of S-NHS in 40 μL of deionized water and approximately 10mg of
   EDC in 200 μL for a final concentration of 50 mg / mL.
    * These solutions are time sensitive.
    * (weight / 50) = amount of DI water to dilute with.
6. Resuspend beads in 80 μL activation buffer.
7. Add 10 μL of S-NHS and 10 μL of EDC to bead suspension (order does not
   matter) and mix by pipetting.
8. Wrap tube in foil and tape tube on vortex at 900 rpm for 20 minutes at room
   temperature.
9. Dilute protein capture solution with coupling buffer to a concentration of
   0.1 mg / mL in a volume of 100 μL.
10. Centrifuge beads for 3 minutes at 10,000 g and discard supernatant.
11. Add diluted protein solution.
12. Agitate tube with activated beads and protein solution overnight at 4°C at
    900 rpm in the dark (wrap in foil).
13. Wash beads 3x with PBS / BSA.
14. Resuspend bead pellet in 1mL PBS / BSA.

## Validate Coupling
1. Determine bead concentration using Luminex and adjust amount of stock used accordingly.
   Try 1:25, 1:50, and 1:100 dilutions. You want 100-200 beads / well.
2. Add Protein-G as the “sample” but skip overnight incubation step to make
   sure your antibody has bound to the bead and run on Luminex.

## Notes

* Coupled beads are good for ~1 year.
* When coupling, you can’t use anything that is in a TRIS buffer.
