# Fibronectin Cell Attachment Protocol

## Equipment & Reagents

* Species Plasma Fibronectin, in powder form
* Sterile H2O
* (Hank's) Sterile Balanced Salt Solution

## Steps

1. Reconstitute with 1 mL sterile H2O / mg of protein.
2. Allow to dissolve for at least 30 minutes at 37°C.
    * A small amount of undissolved material may remain. This will not affect
      product performance.
3. Dilute fibronectin 1:100 in sterile balanced salt solution and coat the
   culture surface with a minimal volume.
    * Use 1‑5 μg fibronectin / cm^2
4. Allow to air dry for at least 45 minutes at room temperature.
    * Excess fibronectin may be removed by aspiration, but is not necessary.
5. Optionally wash with PBS or media.
6. Store at 4°C.

## Example

For a 96-well Costar Clear Polystyrene plate with 25 μL well volumes and
0.34 cm^2 growth area and 5 μg / cm^2 fibronectin:

    0.34 cm^2 * 5 μg / cm^2 / 25 μL = 0.068 μg / μL

    25 μL / well * 96 wells = 2.4 mL, 3 mL total volume to cover 96 wells.

    3 mL * 0.068 mg / mL = 0.204 mg

    0.204 mL of 1 mg / mL stock in 2.796 mL PDB.
