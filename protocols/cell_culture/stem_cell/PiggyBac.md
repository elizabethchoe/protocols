# PiggyBac transformation of Stem Cells

## Equipment & Reagents

* Accutase
* mTesr Media
* OPTImem
* Mirus LT1 Transfection Reagent
* pEF1a-hyPBase (PiggyBac Transposase)
* PB-\<Gene of Interest\>

## Steps

1. Day 0:
    1. Warm up accutase to room temperature.
    2. Warm up mTesr media and add rock inhibitor (1000X).
    3. Wash cells once with PBS and add accutase (1 ml / well for 6-well).
    4. Wait X minutes, remove cells and wash well once with media.
    5. Spin down cells at 200 g for 5 minutes.
    6. Resuspend cells in 2 mL media and count with Countess.
    7. Plate 250k cells / well in a 6-well plate in 2 mL media.
        * Make sure to include a negative control well to validate selection.
2. Day 1:
    1. Morning of transfection (Preferably before 11am):
    2. For each transfection:
        1. Add 200 μL of OPTImem to 1.7 mL tube.
        2. Add 1.5 μg pEF1a-hyPBase.
        3. Add 2 μg of PB-\<Gene of Interest\>.
        4. Add 10.5 μL Mirus LT1.
    3. Wait 20 minutes at room temperature.
    4. Add transfect mixture to cells (Don't change media!).
    5. After 6 hours: Aspirate and add 2 mL media + rock inhibitor to cells.
3. Day 2:
    1. Change media on cells to mTesr + rock inhibitor.
4. Day 3:
    1. Change media on cells to mTesr + rock inhibitor + selection marker at half
       concentration.
        * For puromycin, use 1 μg / mL.
        * For hygromycin, use 10 μg / mL.
        * For blastocidin, use 2 μg / mL.
        * For G418, use X μg / mL.
        * When in doubt, set up a kill curve and use the minimum killing
          concentration with 7 days of selection.
5. Day 4:
    1. Change media on cells to mTesr + selection marker at full concentration.
6. Day 5-7:
    1. Continue selection of cells, then isolate single colonies (or mixed
       populations) and validate the expression of the genes of interest.
