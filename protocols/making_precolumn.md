# Making a pre-column

## Equipment

* Pressure Bomb

* Stir Plate

* Heat Gun (Optional) / Oven (Optional)

* HPLC
    * Used for final conditioning step.

## Reagents

* Capillary Tube
    * OD: 360 μm, ID: 100 μm (Polymicro Technologies cat. no. TSP100375)

* Kasil

* Formamide

* 100% Acetonitrile

* 80% Acetonitrile, 20% Isopropanol

* 10 μm beads
    * YMC gel, ODS-A, 12nm, S-10 μm, AA12S11

* 0.1% Acetic Acid

* Stir Bar

* 10 fmol BSA

## Steps

1. Cut a 20 cm long column with the silicon cutter.
2. Make the first frit on the column.
    1. Mix Kasil and Formamide (5:1) in an eppendorf tube.
    2. Vortex briefly.
    3. Centrifuge for 1 minute.
    4. Quickly dip one end of the column into the tube until the material rises
       into the capillary about 0.5 - 1 cm.
    5. Let the frit polymerize.
        * Blow-dry with heat gun at setting II from about 5 cm distance.
        * OR Let bake in oven at 100°C (setting 5) for 10 minutes on a foil
          tray.
        * OR Leave out in air overnight.
3. Wash the column with 100% Acetonitrile for 5 minutes at 200-400 psi.
4. Pack 10 μm beads.
    1. Add 1 mL 80% Acetonitrile, 20% Isopropanol, a spatula of 10 μm beads,
       and a stir bar to a glass vial.
    2. Place vial in bomb.
    3. Turn stir plate on.
    4. Attach column to bomb.
    5. Load the beads at roughly 500 psi.
    6. Wait until the beads fill up 10 cm length from the end of the frit.
5. Wash the column with 0.1% Acetic Acid for 10 minutes at 500 psi.
6. Dry the column with helium alone for 10 minutes.
7. Make the second frit on the column.
    1. Mix Kasil and Formamide (5:1) in an eppendorf tube.
    2. Vortex briefly.
    3. Centrifuge for 1 minute.
    4. Dip the other end of the capillary and wait for fluid to rise about 0.5
       cm by capillary action.
    5. Let the second frit polymerize.
        * Blow-dry with heat gun at setting II from about 5 cm distance.
        * OR Leave out in air overnight.
        * Do not bake! It will melt the beads.
8. Wash the column with 100% Acetonitrile for 5 minutes at 200-400 psi.
9. Wash the column with 0.1% Acetic Acid for 10 minutes at 500 psi.
10. Make a Teflon connector.
    1. Cut a 2-3 cm length of silicon tubing (green tab).
    2. Force a small length of capillary through the tubing to widen the inner
       hole.
    3. Put the connector on one end of the pre-column.
11. Condition the column with peptides.
    * Load 10 fmol of BSA for 10 minutes at 500 psi.
    * Load 500 fmol of angiotension at low pressure (200-300 psi).
12. Run a few prep gradients on the HPLC to remove remaining peptides from
    column.
