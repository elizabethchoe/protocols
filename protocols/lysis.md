# Urea Cell Lysis

## Reagents

* Ice in ice tray.
    * Ice trays found on top of fridge in wet lab.
    * Ice is found in autoclave room on south side of building.

* 8 M Urea
    * Located on chemical shelf in wet lab.
    * Make fresh!
    * Weigh out urea first, then add water to fill tube up to desired volume,
      vortex and let sit on water bath to help dissolve the urea crystals.
    * Cool down urea on ice before adding it to cells.

* 1 mM Sodium Orthovanadate (Optional)
    * Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor

* Protease Inhibitor (Optional)

* Phosphatase Inhibitor (Optional)

* Cold PBS

## Steps

1. Keep cells on ice for entire procedure.
2. If cell are in culture, pour off the media into a beaker.
3. Rinse the cells with ice cold PBS.
    1. Pour on.
    2. Swirl.
    3. Pour off or aspirate off.
4. Lyse cells in ice cold Urea + inhibitors
    * For 10 cm dishes, add 500 μL Urea.
    * For 15 cm dishes, add 1 mL Urea.
5. Use a cell scraper to lift the cells off the plate into the solution.
    * Scrape in all four directions while holding the dish at a slant in order
      to remove all of the cell and collect them at one end.
6. Pipette the solution into labeled 15 mL conical tubes.
7. Store lysates at -80°C.
