## Equipment

* Rotator

* Table-top Centrifuge

## Reagents

* Ni-NTA Superflow Ni-charged resin (Qiagen cat. no. 30410)
    * 25 mL is more than sufficient (200 μL per run)

* MilliQ $H_2O$

* 100 mM EDTA pH 8.0

* Iron Chloride ($FeCl_2$)
    * Located in fume hood in wet lab within desicator.

* 80% Acetonitrile (MeCN), 0.1% Trifluoacetic Acid (TFA)

* 80% Acetonitrile (MeCN), 0.1% Acetic Acid (AA)

* 0.1% Trifluoroacetic Acid (TFA)

* 10% Trifluoroacetic Acid (TFA)
    * Use a glass pipette to aliquot a small amount into a glass vial.

* 0.1% Acetic Acid (AA)

* 250 mM Sodium Phosphate pH 8.0

* ???% Formic Acid

## Steps

1. Aliquot 300 μL Ni-NTA slurry (150 μL resin) into a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube
   using a wide-tipped pipette.
2. Rinse beads 3x with 800 μL MilliQ $H_2O$.
    * For all rinses, spin at 6500 rpm for 1 minute.
    * Bead loss due to washes is acceptable and taken into account with the
      starting volume of beads.
3. Rinse beads 2x with 800 μL EDTA to strip away nickel.
    * Incubate samples for 10 minutes on rotator between each addition of EDTA
      and the spin-down step.
4. Rinse beads 3x with 800 μL MilliQ $H_2O$ to remove excess EDTA.
5. Apply 800 μL of iron chloride solution to beads and incubate for 30 - 45
   minutes on rotator.
    * If running an IP, begin the final wash and elution steps immediately
      after adding iron to beads.
6. Wash beads 3x with 800 μL MilliQ $H_2O$ to remove excess iron.
7. Wash beads 1x with 800 μL 80% MeCN, 0.1% TFA.
7. Wash beads 1x with 800 μL 0.1% TFA to acidify solution.
8. Resuspend beads in 150 μL 0.1% TFA.
9. Add 20 μL of IP supernant or 30% of fractionated supernant to beads.
10. Acidify supernant with 10 μL 10% TFA.
11. Add 130 μL 80% MeCN, 0.1% TFA to beads.
12. Incubate for 30 - 60 minutes on rotator.
13. Spin down beads and save supernatant.
14. Wash beads 2x with 400 μL 80% MeCN, 0.1% TFA.
15. Wash beads 2x with 400 μL 80% MeCN, 0.1% AA.
16. Wash beads 2x with 400 μL 0.1% AA to remove MeCN.
17. Elute beads in 25 μL Sodium Phosphate pH 8.0.
18. Incubate for 30 minutes on rotator.
19. Place 22 μL of eluate in an autosampler tube.
20. Add 1 μL Formic Acid to tube.
