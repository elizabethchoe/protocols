# *in situ* Proximity Ligation Assay- 2° antibody probes

The assay is performed on fixed cells and tissues. If intracellular targets/epitopes are to
be studied, the cells must also be permeabilized to allow the entry of proximity probes
and other reagents into the cells. When using paraffin-embedded tissue sections, the
paraffin must first be removed. In addition, the tissue must often be treated by antigen
retrieval to enable antibody-based detection of proteins. In this PLA format secondary
proximity probes are directed against primary antibodies, e.g., proximity probes
recognizing mouse and rabbit immunoglobulins in combination with a pair of mouse and
rabbit primary antibodies binding the target proteins. The protocol presented below is
based on a 30-μl reaction volume, sufficient for a surface area of approximately 1 $cm^2$

## Steps

1. Prepare cells or tissue sample:
    1. For cell lines, seed cells onto sterilized glass cover slips place in cell culture dishes.
Culture cells sufficiently to allow attachment to the glass surface and optimal confluency
for processing and imaging (ie. 80-90%). Perform culture treatments or ligand
stimulations as desired before next step.
        * NOTE: It is convenient to carry out the following processing steps with each
cover slip placed into individual wells of 6-well plates. Higher seeding densities
may be required for attachment to glass compared to typical plastic surfaces. For
some cell types, cover slips may require coating to allow cell attachment.
    2. For FFPE tissue, samples should be sectioned onto microscope slides and will
require deparaffinization, rehydration and antigen retrieval before use, optimized for
each specific protein target. Frozen tissue should be sectioned onto microscope slides
and may require additional fixing depending on protein target.
        * NOTE: Optimal tissue section thickness is 5-10 microns.
    3. Wash samples in Wash Buffer 3X 5 minutes on belly dancer.
    4. Fix the samples (optional for frozen tissue, omit for FFPE tissue) with suitable fixative
(ie. 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min @ RT).
    5. Wash 3X 5 minutes in Wash Buffer. After 2nd wash, delimit ~1 $cm^2$ area of cells or
tissue section with ImmEdge hydrophobic barrier pen. Dry sample area sufficiently or
wax may not adhere. Perform 3rd wash to rehydrate sample, ensure wax has stuck, and
remove residual wax sample.
    6. Treat samples with Permeabilization Buffer (ie. 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3min @ RT for
RTK targets).
        * NOTE: The nature of the protein target will determine the optimal type of fixative
and permeabilization buffer, as well as the duration of treatment.
    7. Wash 1X 5 minutes in Wash Buffer.
    8. Prepare fresh Blocking solution (see PLA buffers and solutions appendix) and apply
to the sample reaction area. Incubate for 45 minutes @37°C in a humidity chamber (eg.
TC incubator).
    9. Dilute primary antibodies to optimized concentration in fresh PLA probe solution (see
PLA buffers and solutions appendix). Remove Blocking solution from slides and apply
primary antibody solution to the sample reaction area. Incubate overnight at 4 °C
        * NOTE: Seal the container with Parafilm to prevent evaporation from the opendroplet
reaction.
    10. Wash 3X 5 minutes in Antibody Wash Buffer to remove unbound primaries.
2. Perform proximity ligation assay:
    1. Dilute appropriate species-specific secondary proximity PLUS and MINUS probes to
optimized concentration in fresh PLA probe solution (see PLA buffers and solutions
appendix) and apply solution to the sample reaction area. Incubate 60 minutes @37°C
in a humidity chamber (eg. TC incubator).
        * NOTE: Do not allow the samples to dry at any point following primary antibody
incubation as this will cause high background signal. Generally, a higher
concentration is needed when tissue sections are stained compared to cells
cultured on slides. Incubation time may vary from 30-120 minutes depending on
the abundance of target. Adjusting the secondary probe incubation time has the
greatest effect on PLA signal density
    2. Wash 3X 5 minutes in Antibody Wash Buffer to remove unbound PLA probes.
    3. Prepare fresh Hybridization/Ligation Buffer (see PLA buffers and solutions
appendix) and apply to the sample reaction area. Incubate for 30 minutes @37°C in a
humidity chamber (eg. TC incubator).
    4. Wash 2X 5 minutes in Antibody Wash Buffer to remove unbound connector oligos.
    5. Prepare fresh RCA Buffer (see PLA buffers and solutions appendix) and apply to the
sample reaction area. Incubate for 100 minutes @37°C in a humidity chamber (eg. TC
incubator).
        * NOTE: Incubation time may vary from 90-150 minutes depending on desired
signal to noise ratio. Adjusting the rolling-circle amplification time effectively
changes the length of the rolling-circle product (RCP) and thus the intensity of
each individual RCP signal.
    6. Wash 2X 5 minutes in Antibody Wash Buffer to remove polymerase.
    7. Prepare fresh Detection Buffer (see PLA buffers and solutions appendix) and apply
to the sample reaction area. Incubate for 60 minutes @37°C in a humidity chamber (eg.
TC incubator).
        * NOTE: The detection oligonucleotide has been labeled with the Alexa 555
fluorophore; however, the fluorophore can be replaced by any other desired
fluorophore. Additionally, simultaneous IF to another target (ie. incubation with
fluorophore labeled primary antibody) can be performed at this step if desired.
    8. Wash 2X 5 minutes in Antibody Wash Buffer to remove excess detection probes.
Wash 1X 5 minutes in TBS to remove detergent.
    9. Place small drop (~20uL) Vectashield mounting media on microscope slide.
    10. Hook serrated forceps onto edge of cover slip, lift gently out of well and place face
up on paper towel. Dry cover slip completely with aspirator.
    11. Place one edge of cover slip onto slide and lower slowly (cell side down) onto the
slide to reduce air bubbles getting trapped in mounting media. Press down on top of
cover slip with wide end of 1000uL pipette tip to ensure mounting media spreads across
slip, aspirate any residual that forms around edge of slip.
    12. Seal all edges of slip with nail polish and let dry at least 15 min.
    13. Image!

*CRITICAL NOTE*: Before the PLA signals can be trusted, the primary antibodies and
proximity probes need to be characterized to ensure selective binding. This
characterization should involve a range of technical and biological controls, both
positive and negative. Technical controls can include conditions where i) one of the two
primary antibodies are excluded, ii) one of the two PLA probes are excluded, iii) cells
where the protein is known to be expressed (transfection) vs. non-expressed (RNAi).
Biological controls can include conditions where PLA signal is modulated by i) ligand
stimulation, ii) inhibitor treatment, iii) mutation of interaction interface, etc.

Successful in situ PLA generates bright fluorescent spots with a diameter just below a
micrometer in size, easily distinguishable in a fluorescence microscope (Figure A). In
some cases, when studying highly expressed proteins, the density of signals may be so
high that the signals coalesce (Figure B). In cases with abundant signal, modification of
primary antibody dilution, or proximity probe dilution/incubation time can resolve this
issue.

Parameters such as fixation, antigen retrieval, permeabilization, primary antibody
performance/concentration can be optimized in immunofluorescence experiments.
Alternatively, these parameters can be tested in a single recognition PLA format
whereby one primary antibody is detected by two secondary proximity probes (ie. antimouse
PLUS and anti-mouse MINUS proximity probes recognizing a mouse primary
antibody bound to the target protein. The single recognition format is preferred for
testing as it gives a better indication of dual recognition PLA performance compared to
IF experiments.
