# Western Blot

## Reagents

* SDS-PAGE Gel
    * Located in boxes above Vibhuti's bench.

* Loading Buffer
    * Use 2X Laemmli sample buffer or 4X Loading Buffer.
    * 4X Loading Buffer located above Vibhuti's bench.

* 1 M Stock Dithiothreitol (DTT)

* Running Buffer
    * NuPAGE MOPS Buferr

* Transfer Buffer
    * 20% Methanol
    * 1 L Tris-Gly (2X)
    * Fill to 2 L with MilliQ Water
    * Store at 4 °C.

* Blocking Buffer
    * 50% Odyssey
    * 50% PBS

* Washing Buffer
    * 100 mL 10X TPBS
    * 900 mL MilliQ Water
    * 1 mL Tween (0.1%)
    * Mix with a stir bar for 30 minutes.

## Steps

1. First measure the protein concentration of all of your samples using a
   [BCA Assay](bca.md).
    * Make sure to spin down all samples at 13,400 rpm for 15 minutes in the
      cold room to clear out any lipid debris.
    * Keep all samples on ice when not actively in use.
2. Aliquot 25 - 50 μg of sample in up to 25 μL. Add 4X loading buffer and 1:10
   stock DTT to sample.
3. Boil samples at 70 °C for 10 minutes on a heat block.
4. Load equal amounts of protein into each well of a SDS-PAGE gel.
    * Make sure to remove insulating tape from bottom of gel.
5. Load 8 μL of a molecular weight marker into the left or right-most lane.
5. Run the gel at 130 V for 1-1:30 hours.
6. Prepare a membrane stack for transferring the protein from the gel to a
   membrane.
    1. Crack open gel.
    2. Layer a sponge, filter paper, gel, membrane, filter paper, and sponge.
       The membrane should be located closer to the positive (red) electrode
       when transferring proteins.
        * Use either a nitrocellulose membrane or an activated PDVF membrane.
          To activate a PDVF membrane, let is soak in 100% methanol for a few
          seconds and then equilibrate in transfer buffer until it sinks.
    3. After adding each layer to the sandwich, use a roller to remove any air
       bubbles.
7. Plate the membrane stack in a transfer container with transfer buffer, a stir
   bar, and an ice pack.
8. Run the transfer step capping at 80 V or 0.50 Amps for 2 hours in the cold
   room on a stir plate.
    * Check that the current is between 300 and 500 mA, if it is lower, that
      may cause an inefficient transfer. If the voltage is higher than 80 V,
      you may boil your gel as well.
9. Test Ponceau staining to quickly check for successful protein transfer.
    1. Pour Ponceau red stain onto membrane in box.
    2. Incubate on rotator for up to 10 minutes.
    3. Pour Ponceau stain off and wash several times with MilliQ water.
    4. Check for successful staining in lanes of membrane with lysate as well as
       for a red-ish tinge on the molecular weight markers.
10. Block the membrane in 20 mL of blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature
    or overnight at 4 °C.
    * This and following steps will remove any residual Ponceau red from your
      membrane.
11. Incubate the membrane with an appropriately diluted primary antibody
    overnight at 4 °C.
    1. Use 50 mL blocking buffer with 100 μL of 0.2% Tween added.
12. Wash the membrane flour times with washing buffer. Let membrane sit with
    buffer for 5 minutes on rotator between adding and pouring off.
13. If using a secondary antibody, add antibody at 1:20,000 dilution in 2 mL of
    blocking buffer with 0.2% Tween.
14. Incubate for 1 hour on rotator.
15. Wash the membrane four times with washing buffer as before.
16. Re-suspend membrane in 1X PBS.
17. Acquire images on the LiCor next to the Yaffe lab.
18. Strip membrane of antibody for further staining analyses.
