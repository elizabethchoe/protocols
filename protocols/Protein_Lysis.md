# Cell Lysis for Protein Extraction

## Initial Notes

* Protocol for drug addition to 12 well plates, but can modify accordingly
* Do everything on ice, so as to prevent further changes to protein levels
* From lysate, need 3 wells of 10 μl of 1:10 and 1:100 dilution for BCA
    * 3 wells 25 μl of1:5 dilution for Luminex

## Reagents

* 10mL lysis buffer
 * 1 tablet protease inhibitor (cOmplete mini with 25 tablets/bottle; Roche)
    * 1 aliquot phosphatase inhibitor (Boston BioProducts BP-479)
        * (in fridge at farthest end)
        * Only need phosphatase inhibitor if doing phopho measurements or Western
        * 10 mL NP4O lysis buffer (pH 7.5)
        * Contains 20mM Tris HCl, 2mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 10% glycerol
            * Weigh out Tris HCl/NaCl ; dilute EDTA

* PBS (non-sterile)

* Costar 96 well V bottom plates (2; by TC stuff)

* 2.0 ml 96 deep well plates (2; on top of 2nd bench)
    * Or can just use 2 more V bottom plates, ie. if don’t need to store that much supernatant
        * Need ~100 μl supernatant for Luminex
        * Also need some for BCA

* Cell scraper (small for 6 well plates and smaller, large for dishes; by TC stuff)

## Steps

1. Day before: if necessary, make lysis buffer (100 ml at a time, store indefinitely at 4°C)
2. Day of: add inhibitors to 10 ml lysis buffer
    1. Vortex so inhibitor dissolves faster, can store for ~1 week at 4°C
3. On ice (ice room key by TC white board):
    1. Remove 800 μL media from source wells and save in 1st deep well plate
    2. Aspirate rest of media
    3. Wash source wells with 1mL non-sterile PBS and aspirate -> do 2x
    4. Add 200 μl lysis buffer into each source well (for 12 well plate)
    5. Scrape and wipe scraper for each well to get suspended cells
    6. Wipe scraper with kimwipe in between each well
4. Lysate: Shake at 200 rpm for 20 min (cold room across the hall)
5. Sup: Meanwhile, cover deep well plate containing supernatant with clear film
    1. Centrifuge at 1000 g for 5 min – to remove cell debris
        1. Cover with clear plate sealer (in right drawer)
        2. Make balance with H2O using empty deep well plate near ViCell
    2. Take 600 μl sup to store in 2nd deep well plate
        1. Cover with foiled plate sealer (in right drawer, more near pH meter)
        2. Store at -20°C
6. Lysate: Transfer 170 μL lysate from each well to 2nd 96 well plate
    1. Centrifuge at max speed for 20 min – to get only protein in this supernatant
        1. Make balance with H2O using empty 96 well plate in right drawer
    2. Take 125 μl sup to store in 2nd 96 well plate
        1. Cover with foiled plate sealer (in right drawer, more near pH meter)
        2. Store at -20°C
