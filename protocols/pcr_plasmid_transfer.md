# Transferring Plasmids by PCR

## Steps

1. PCR Amplification
    1. Design forward and reverse PCR primers to your gene.
        * Ensure the melting temperature is ...
        * Either your gene contains enzyme cut sites for cloning or your primers
          contain an overhang with the cut site.
        * ...
    2. Prepare a mix of template and primer DNA:
        * 15 ng template DNA
        * 1 μL of 10 μM of forward and reverse primers
        * 2X Phusion polymerase mix
        * Bring up to 20 μL total volume with DNA/RNA-ase free water
    3. Place PCR tube in a thermocycler
    4. Run a protocol to anneal, amplify for 30 cyclers, and finally hold at 4 °C.
    5. PCR products can be stored at -20 °C or immediately run on a gel.
2. Agarose Gel Purification
    1. Prepare a 1% agarose gel.
        1. Mix 70 μL TAE buffer, .7 g agarose, and 7 μL GelRed in an Erlenmeyer
           flask.
        2. Microwave flask for 90 seconds. Check solution for absense of gel
           droplets, microwave again for 30 seconds if need be.
        3. Pour gel and let it polymerize in the cold room for 10-15 minutes.
            * Gel should be opaque-ish when ready.
        4. Transfer gel to electrophoresis chamber and cover with TAE buffer.
        5. Add 6 μL DNA ladder to left-most lane of gel.
    2. Add 6X gel loading dye to PCR products and transfer them to the gel using
       thin pipette loading tips.
    3. Cover electrophesis chamber and attach to electrical source.
    4. Run gel at 100 V for 45 min - 1 hour.
        * Check for bubbles in chamber to indicate electrical current.
        * Gels can be run for a shorter amount of time if just purifying PCR
          product from plasmid.
    5. Turn off electrical source, transfer gel to Saran wrap.
    6. Take gel, clean razor blade, and 1.5 mL tubes to dark room.
    7. Use hand-held UV lamp or UV plate to illuminate gel.
        * Make sure to wear proper protective equipment to avoid irradiating
          your lovely face.
    8. Locate band according to your PCR product's size. Use razor blade to cut
        band as finely as possible.
    9. Transfer gel fragment into 1.5 mL tube.
    10. Follow QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit protocol to extract DNA from gel.
    11. Store DNA elution at -20 °C or use immediately for ligation.
3. DNA Ligation
    1. Use a nanospectrometer to measure the concentrations of your plasmids
       and insert. Calculate the molar ratio by dividing the mass of both by
       their length.
    2. Use 200 ng of vector at a 1:3 ratio with insert DNA for the following
       steps.
    3. Perform a DNA digest by mixing DNA nucleases with each insert and vector
       in separate tubes with the following reagents:
        * 1 μL of each enzyme
        * 1 μL of 10X CutSmart Buffer or other compatible buffer
        * 1 μL Antarctic Phosphatase + 1 μL Antarctic Phosphatase Buffer to
          vectors to avoid re-ligation.
        * Bring volume up to 10 μL using DNase-free water
    4. Incubate tubes at 37 °C for 30 minutes.
    5. Incubate tubes at 80 °C for 2 minutes to heat-inactivate the enzymes.
    6. Transfer insert solutions to their appropriate vectors.
    7. Add 1 μL T4 DNA ligase and 2 μL 10X DNA ligase buffer to vector-insert
       mixes.
    8. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
