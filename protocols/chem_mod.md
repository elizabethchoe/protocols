# Chemical Modification and Digestion

## Reagents

* 100 mM Ammonium Acetate pH 8.9

* 1 M DTT (Sigma D0632) in Ammonium Acetate solution
    * Located in wet lab fridge
    * Always make fresh!
    * Final concentration should be 10 mM DTT when added to lysate

* 800 mM Iodoacetamide (Sigma I1144) in Ammonium Acetate solution
    * Located in wet lab fridge within desicant container
    * Always make fresh!
    * Final conecntration should be 55 mM IAA when added to lysate

* Trypsin (Promega V5113)
    * Located in -80°C, each tube is 20 μg / 50 μL
    * Add trypsin at 1:50 (1 μg trypsin : 50 μg lysate, 20 μg trypsin : 1 mg
      lysate)

* Acetic Acid (99.99%)
    * Located in Acids cabinet underneath fume hood

## Steps

1. Begin with 1 mg protein in 4 mL volume, adjust volumes accordingly if you
   are starting with more or less lysate.
2. Add 40 μL DTT solution to lysate.
3. Vortex lysate.
4. Incubate in 56°C water bath for 1 hour.
5. Add 300 μL IAA solution to lysate.
6. Wrap tube in tin foil to block UV light from degrading IAA.
7. Incubate on rotator for 1 hour.
8. Add 8-9 mL Ammonium Acetate pH 8.9 to quench reaction.
9. Add trypsin to lysate.
10. Incubate on rotator overnight (18-24 hours).
11. Stop the reaction by adding 1 mL Acetic Acid.
12. Store samples in -80 °C.
