# Peptide Fractionation



## Reagents

* Solvent A
    * Make at least 500 mL

* Solvent B
    * Make at least 500 mL

* Column

* Lyophilized peptides

## Steps

1. Email Dick Cook <dick@mit.edu> to set up an appointment to use the Koch
   Institute's HPLC and fractionator.
2. Equilibrate column / run gradient...
2. Set up method / sequence
2. Set up fractionator
2. The syringe for injecting sample into the HPLC has a maximum capacity of 200
   μL, so dissolve your sample in 200 μL of solvent A, vortex thoroughly,
   and spin down to remove solvent from walls of tube.
2. Run sequence
