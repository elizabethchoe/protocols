# Making a Fritted Analytical Column

## Equipment & Reagents

* Laser Puller
    * Sutter Instrument Co. Model P-2000
* Pressure Bomb
* Stir Plate
* Oven (Optional)
* Capillary Tube
    * OD: 360 μm, ID: 50 μm (Polymicro Technologies)
* Lithisil
    * PQ Corporation
* Tetramethylammonium (TFA) Silicate
    * Sigma-Aldrich
* Formamide
    * Sigma-Aldrich
* Ultrapure (MS-grade) Water
    * Make fresh every time to avoid leftover particulate that may clog your
      column.
* 80% Methanol, 20% Chloroform
    * Located in flammables cabinet below fume hood in wet lab.
    * Chloroform prevents beads from aggregating, columns pack much more
      quickly.
* 3 or 5 μm Beads
    * 5 μm beads are preferable.
* Stir Bar
* 0.1% Formic Acid
* 10 fmol BSA

## Steps

1. Cut a 25 cm column with the silicon cutter.
2. Burn off about 5 cm of coating from one end of the column using a lighter.
3. Remove excess material with methanol and kimwipe.
4. Pull the tip.
    1. Fix the capillary in the laser puller, with the end of the coating
       aligned with the left closure.
    2. Pull the tip using program 58 with desired parameters (i.e. Line 6: heat
       250 - 252, vel 13). The full list of parameters are:
        * 280 - 15 - 128
        * 270 - 15 - 128
        * 260 - 15 - 128
        * 240 - 15 - 128
        * 230 - 15 - 128
        * 252 - 13 - 125
    3. Check the tip under a microscope.
5. Make the frit.
    1. Mix 100 μL Lithisil and 50 μL TFA Silicate in a new tube.
    2. Vortex the mixture.
    3. Spin down for 6 seconds.
    4. Add 10 μL Formamide.
    5. Vortex the mixture.
    6. Spin down for 6 seconds.
    7. Draw 50 μL of mixture into a 200 μL pipette.
    8. Expel mixture until a droplet is hanging from the end of the pipette tip.
    9. Move the droplet over the tip of the column.
        * Excess material on the outside is common, does not affect performance.
          Wipe off with kimwipe if desired.
    10. Let the frit polymerize.
        * Let bake in oven at 100°C for 10 minutes on a foil tray.
        * OR leave out in air overnight.
6. Attach column to pressure bomb.
7. Flow ultrapure water at 1000 psi to flush out excess material.
    * If tip does not flow, gently flame the end while under pressure until you
      can see spray or droplet come out the end.
8. Pack the column using 3 or 5 μm beads.
    1. Add 1 mL 80% Methanol, 20% Chloroform, a spatula of beads, and a stir bar
       to glass vial.
9. Flush the column with 0.1% Formic Acid for 10 minutes at 1000 psi.
10. Condition the column with peptides.
    * Load 10 fmol BSA for 10 minutes at 1000 psi.
11. Store the column with the tip in acetic acid to prevent it drying out.
