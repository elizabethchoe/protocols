# Making an IMAC Column

## Equipment & Reagents

* Pressure Bomb
* Stir Plate
* Heat Gun (Optional) / Oven (Optional)
* Capillary Tube
    * OD: 360 μm, ID: 200 μm (Polymicro Technologies cat. no. TSP200350)
* Kasil
* Formamide
* 100% Acetonitrile
* Ultra-pure / Nano-pure / Mass-Spec Grade Water
* Poros 20 MC beads
    * Applied Biosystems cat. no. 1-5429-06
* Stir Bar

## Steps

1. Cut a 20 cm long column with the silicon cutter.
2. Make the first frit on the column.
    1. Mix Kasil and Formamide (5:1) in an eppendorf tube.
    2. Vortex briefly.
    3. Centrifuge for 1 minute.
    4. Quickly dip one end of the column into the tube until the material rises
       into the capillary about 0.5 - 1 cm.
    5. Let the frit polymerize.
        * Blow-dry with heat gun at setting II from about 5 cm distance.
        * OR Let bake in oven at 100°C (setting 5) for 10 minutes on a foil
          tray.
        * OR Leave out in air overnight.
3. Wash the column with 100% Acetonitrile for 5 minutes at minimal pressure.
4. Pack Poros beads.
    1. Add 1 mL MilliQ water, a spatula of beads, and a stir bar to a glass
       vial.
    3. Turn stir plate on.
    2. Place vial in bomb.
    4. Attach column to bomb.
    5. Load the beads at roughly 500 psi.
    6. Wait until the beads fill up 10-12 cm length from the end of the frit.
5. Wash the column with 100% Acetonitrile for 10 minutes at 400-500 psi.
6. Dry the column with helium alone for 10 minutes.
7. Make the second frit on the column.
    1. Mix Kasil and Formamide (5:1) in an eppendorf tube.
    2. Vortex briefly.
    3. Centrifuge for 1 minute.
    4. Dip the other end of the capillary and wait for fluid to rise about 0.5
       cm by capillary action.
    5. Let the second frit polymerize.
        * Blow-dry with heat gun at setting II from about 5 cm distance.
        * OR Leave out in air overnight.
        * Do not bake! It will melt the beads.
8. Wash the column with 100% Acetonitrile for 5 minutes at 200-400 psi.
9. Make a Teflon connector.
    1. Cut a 2-3 cm length of silicon tubing (green tab).
    2. Force a small length of capillary through the tubing to widen the inner
       hole.
    3. Put the connector on one end of the IMAC column.
