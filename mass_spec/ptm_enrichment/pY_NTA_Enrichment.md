# pY High-Select Fe-NTA Enrichment

## Equipment & Reagents

* High-Select Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (A32992, Thermo)

## Steps

After the rinse steps in IP:

1. Elute with 25 uL 0.2% TFA for 10 min at room temperature on rotator.
   While the peptides are eluting, prepare the FeNTA columns
   1. Remove the bottom closure of the spin columns and loosen the cap.
   2. Place in a 1.7 mL ( (or 2 mL) microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 1000xg for 30s.
   3. Add 200 uL of Binding/Wash buffer. Centrifuge at 1000xg for 30s.
      Repeat once.
   4. Cap the bottom of the column with the white Luer plug. Place the column with the plug into new microcentrifuge tube. Label the microcentrifuge tube if you are planning to analyze the flow through (FT).
   5. Resuspend the beads in 25 μL Binding/wash buffer.
2. Centrifuge pY elution for 1 min at 6500 rpm on table-top centrifuge. Remove eluted peptides and add them to FeNTA beads. Just leave the FeNTA column at room temp.
3. Repeat the elution step: 25 μL 0.2% TFA for 10 min at room temperature on rotator.
4. Centrifuge for 1 min, remove eluted peptides and add them to FeNTA beads.
5. Mix the sample and FeNTA beads by holding the screw cap and very gently tapping the bottom plug for 10s until the beads are in suspension.
   Important! Avoid splashing the sample.
6. Incubate for 30 min at room temp. Mix the resin gently every 5 mins.
7. During the incubation step, condition the elution tube with BSA
   1. Add 1 μg tryptic digested-BSA in 40 μL 0.1% Acetic Acid to a 1.7 mL eppendorf tube.
   2. Vortex for 10 seconds.
   3. Speed-vac to dryness (25-30 minutes)
   4. Rinse tube 4x:
      1. Add 40 μL of:
         * 1x SpinColumn elution buffer
         * 2x with 10% Acetonitrile .1% Acetic Acid
         * 1x with .1% Acetic Acid
      2. Vortex for 5 seconds, spin down briefly.
      3. Remove liquid from tube by pipette.
8. Carefully remove the bottom plug and loosen the cap.
    Do not squeeze the bottom of the plug.
9. Place the column back into FT tube. Centrifuge at 1000xg for 30s.
10. Store the FT at -20 C (only if you need to analyze the FT).
11. Place the column in a new microcentrifuge tube.
12. Wash the column with 150 μL Binding/Wash buffer. Centrifuge at 1000xg for 30s.
    Repeat the wash twice for a total of 3 washes. Discard the wash flow-through.
13. Wash the columns with 200 μL LC-MS grade water. Centrifuge at 1000xg for 30s.
14. Place the column in a BSA-coated microcentrifuge tube. Cut the cap off such that the tube fits in bomb loader.
15. Elute phosphopeptides twice from the column:
      1. Add 20 μL of Elution buffer to the column.
      2. Centrifuge at 1000xg for 30s.
16. Speed-vac the sample until 1-5 μL remains (18-20 mins).
   * Important! Pay attention to sample volume. Do not dry the sample. Volumes > 5 μL may cause peptide chromatography issues.
   * If sample volume is > 5 μL, place back in speed-vac and check every 5 minutes.
17. Resuspend the sample in 10 μL 5% Acetonitrile in 0.1% Formic Acid. Do not vortex. Avoid splashing the sample.
18. Bomb load sample directly onto an analytical column. Loading can take 60-90 mins. Make sure the column does not run dry.
19. Run on the instrument.
