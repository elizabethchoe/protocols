# Isoelectric Focusing (IEF)

When using the Zoom IEF Fractionator, you will have a long tub with eight
sites for disks / spacers, dividing the tub into nine chambers:

1. (+) Anode
2. #1: pI 3.0 - 4.6
3. #2: pI 4.6 - 5.4
4. #3: pI 5.4 - 6.2
5. #4: pI 6.2 - 7.0
6. #5: pI 7.0 - 9.1
7. #6: pI 9.1 - 10
8. #7: pI 10 - ???
9. (-) Cathode

For histone fractionation, you will want disks at the 3.0, 7.0, and 10 sites to
divide your sample into mostly non-histones (3.0 - 7.0) and actyl-lysine
histone peptides (7.0 - 10).

When loading the fractionator, you will want three primary buffers: two for the
cathode and anode, and one for the sample. The sample should be loaded at 670
μL per chamber,

## Equipment

* Invitrogen Zoom Isoelectric Focusing Fractionator
    * Located in wet lab on Jose's old bench.

## Reagents

* Anode Buffer
    * 8.4 grams Zoom Urea
    * 3.0 grams Zoom Thiouera
    * 3.3 mL Novex IEF Anode buffer (50X)
    * Adjust the volume to 20 mL with MilliQ Water.
    * Check pH is 3.0

* Cathode Buffer
    * 8.4 grams Zoom Urea
    * 3.0 grams Zoom Thiourea
    * 2.0 mL Novex IEF Cathode buffer pH 3 - 10 (10X)
    * Adjust the volume to 20 mL with MilliQ Water.
    * Check pH is 10.4

* 2 M DTT
    * Dissolve 0.03 grams DTT in 100 μL MilliQ Water.

* IP Supernatant
    * 670 μL per chamber
    * Add 2 M DTT at 1:100 of total volume
    * Add ampholytes at 1:100 of total volume
    * Add MilliQ Water to fill volume up to the total volume calculated for all
      chambers

## Steps

1. Assemble the chambers and disks on the fractionator as desired.
2. Load 17.5 mL of anode buffer to the + reservoir.
3. Load 17.5 mL of cathode buffer to the - reservoir.
4. Load 670 μL of prepared sample to each sample chamber.
5. Attach to power supply and use program 1.
    * 100 V for 20 minutes.
    * 200 V for 80 minutes.
    * 600 V for 80 minutes.
    * Current limit is 2 mA and power limit is 2 W.
6. After 3 hours, remove the sample chamber and collect each fraction.
7. Wash each chamber with 500 μL MilliQ Water and add each wash to the appropriate
   fraction.
8. Store samples at -80°C or continue with Sep-Paking.
    1. If Sep-Paking, acidify samples with 500 μL Formic Acid.
    2. Use Sep-Pak Lights
    3. Elute with 3 mL 90% Acetonitrile.
    4. Speed-vac samples (3 - 5 hours) (Do not speed-vac overnight!)
    5. Store samples at -80°C.

## Cleanup

1. Dispose of buffers in the liquid hazardous waste area.
2. Wash components of fractionator in the sink, making sure not to let O-rings
   or blank separators go down the drain.
3. Wrap membranes in a paper towel and dispose of them in the trash.
