# pY Immunopreciptation

All steps for the pY immunoprecipitation should be performed in the cold room
until the final elution step. Rinses on the second day should be performed at
the same time as the initial IMAC EDTA / water / iron washes.

## Equipment

* Centrifuge

* Rotator

## Reagents

* Protein G Agarose Beads (Calbiochem IP08)

* pY Antibodies
    * 4G10 (Millipore) - 1 μg / μL
    * PT66 (Sigma) - 2 μg / μL
    * PY100 (CST) (Optional) - 1 μg / μL

* IP Buffer
    * 100 mM Tris-HCl, 0.3% NP-40, pH 7.4

* iTRAQ IP Buffer
    * 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1% NP-40, pH 7.4

* Rinse Buffer
    * 100 mM Tri-HCl, pH 7.4

* Elution Buffer
    * 100 mM Glycine, pH 2-2.5

* Basic pH-ing Buffer
    * 500 mM Tris buffer pH 8.5

## Steps

1. Phosphotyrosine IP Setup
    1. Add 60 μL agarose beads to fresh tube using blunt-tip pipette.
    2. Add 300 μL IP buffer to tube.
    3. Spin down at 6500 rpm for 1 minute.
    4. Remove supernatant.
    5. Add 300 μL IP buffer.
    6. Add 12 μL 4G10 antibody.
    7. Add 9 μL PT66 antibody, 6 μL if using PY100.
    8. Add 6 μL PY100 antibody (optional).
    9. Incubate on rotator for 6-8 hours at 4°C.
    10. Spin down at 6500 rpm for 1 minute.
    11. Remove supernatant.
    12. Wash beads with 400 μL IP buffer.
    13. Incubate on rotator for 5 minutes at 4°C.
    14. Spin down at 6500 rpm for 1 minute.
    15. Remove supernatant.
2. Prepare the sample.
    1. For labeled samples, resuspend in 150 μL iTRAQ IP buffer + 300 μL MilliQ
       water (Or 400 μL iTRAQ IP buffer).
    2. For unlabeled samples, resuspend in 400 μL IP buffer.
    3. Vortex until sample dissolves.
    4. Spin down sample to remove liquid from walls.
    5. Check the pH of the sample solution with a minimal volume (i.e. 2
       μL). Compare pH with that of tube with beads and antibodies. If they are
       dissimilar, add Basic pH-ing Buffer.
          * Start with 1-2 μL of buffer for unlabeled samples.
          * Start with 5-10 μL of buffer for labeled samples.
3. Add sample to beads.
4. Incubate on rotator overnight at 4 °C.
5. Spin down at 6500 rpm for 1 minute.
6. Remove and save supernatant, store in -80 °C.
7. Wash beads with 400 μL iTRAQ IP buffer.
    1. Add buffer.
    2. Spin down at 6500 rpm for 1 minute.
    3. Discard supernatant.
8. Wash beads 3 times with 400 μL IP Rinse buffer.
    1. Add buffer.
    2. Spin down at 6500 rpm for 1 minute.
    3. Discard supernatant.
9. Add 70 μL elution buffer.
10. Incubate on rotator for 30 minutes at room temperature.
11. Load eluate onto an IMAC column.
