# Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC)

## Equipment

* Pressure Bomb

* HPLC

## Reagents

* EDTA

* Ultra-pure / Nano-pure / Mass-Spec Grade Water

* Fe(III) Chloride ($FeCl_3$)
    * Sigma-Aldrich 451649
    * Located in fume hood in wet lab within desicator.

* 0.1% Acetic Acid

* Organic Rinse

* Elution Buffer

## Steps

1. Attach the IMAC column to the pressure bomb.
2. Clean the IMAC column of previous reagents.
    1. Flow EDTA for at least 10 minutes at 10-12 μL / min.
    2. Flow MilliQ water for at least 10 minutes at 10-12 μL / min.
3. Condition the IMAC column.
    1. Flow Iron Chloride for at least 5 minutes at a rate of 10-12 μL / min.
    2. Flip the column in place on the bomb.
    3. Flow Iron Chloride for at least 5 minutes at a rate of 10-12 μL / min.
    4. Flow Acetic Acid for at least 10 minutes at a rate of 10-12 μL / min.
4. Load the sample.
    1. Place a conditioned pre-column on the end of the IMAC column.
        * Whenever you re-attach the teflon connector to the IMAC column, make
          sure to detach the column from the bomb. If the column is still
          attached, you have an increased chance of snapping it while forcing
          the connector back on.
    2. Test the connection with Acetic Acid at 800 psi.
    3. Determine the pressure needed to establish a flow rate just below 1 μL /
       min.
    4. Replace the Acetic Acid with sample in the bomb.
    5. Load sample at <= 1 μL / min.
    6. For analysis of the flow through, flush the column with 5 μL of Acetic
       Acid.
5. (Optional) Run the flow through.
    1. Transfer the pre-column to a HPLC and wash with Acetic Acid for 10 min.
    2. Attach pre-column and analytical column to mass spectrometer.
    3. Run a 1 hour gradient on the HPLC.
6. Wash the IMAC column.
    1. Rinse the column with organic rinse for at least 5 min at 10-12 μL / min.
    2. Flip the column in place on the bomb.
    3. Rinse the column with organic rinse for at least 5 min at 10-12 μL / min.
    4. Rinse the column with Acetic Acid for at least 10 min at 10-12 μL / min.
7. Elute from the IMAC column.
    1. Place a second pre-column on the IMAC column.
    2. Test the connection with Acetic Acid at 500-700 psi.
    3. Elute from the IMAC column with 40 μL of elution buffer.
        * This can be done at 2+ μL / min, just make sure whatever pressure you
          use does not cause leaks.
8. Transfer the pre-column to another pressure bomb and wash with Acetic Acid
   for 15-20 min to remove residual phosphosate buffer.
