# Measuring RNA Concentration

## Instruments

* NanoDrop
    * Located in Hynes.

## Steps

1. Select RNA option on NanoDrop.
2. Spot 1.5 μL of blank solution (RNase free water) onto NanoDrop.
3. Take at least 2 blank readings. The instrument may require more if it sees
   too much variance in absorption of the first two.
4. Clean the stage with a Kimwipe.
5. Spot 1.5 μL of purified RNA onto stage.
6. Record RNA concentration in ng / μL.
7. Clean the stage with a Kimwipe.
8. Record activity in log next to instrument.
