# Measuring Phagocytosis by Flow Cytometry

## Equipment & Reagents

* FluoSpheres® (Blue-Green) (Thermo: F13080)
* Aβ-Alexa Fluor-488 (AnaSpec: AS-60479-01)
* Dextran, Alexa Fluor® 488 (Thermo: D22910)
* Flow Cytometry Buffer (FCB)
    * 10% FBS, 1 mM EDTA, PBS without calcium or magnesium.
    * Keep on ice.

## Steps

1. Day 1
    1. Fill each well of a 24-well plate with 2 mL of media.
    2. Plate 50k cells per well.
        * Use enough wells to allow for one of each fluorophore plus
          fluorophore-free control well for each cell line.
    3. Spin down the plate at 200g for 3 minutes in the Khoeler lab centrifuge.
2. Day 2
    1. Add each fluorophore to their respective wells.
        * Use 5 μL / mL of FluoSpheres, and 250 ng / mL of Aβ and Dextran.
    2. Let cells incubate with fluorophores for 3 hours.
    3. Aspirate off media with fluorophores.
    3. Move plate to ice, wash wells twice with 1 mL FCB. Collect washes.
    4. Spin down cells at 300g for 5 minutes.
    5. Resuspend cells in 100 μL FCB.
    6. Add 0.5 μL fluorophore-conjugated antibody, incubate on ice for 1 hour.
    7. Add 5 mL FBC to wash away free antibody.
    8. Spin down at 300g for 5 minutes. Resuspend in 750 μL FCB.
    7. Filter cells through the top of Falcon 12x75mm polystyrene tubes.
    8. Keep cells on ice until Flow Cytometry appointment.
