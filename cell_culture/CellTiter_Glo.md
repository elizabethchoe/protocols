# Cell Titer Glo Assay

##  Step

1. Plate 10k cells in 200 μL of media in an opaque-backed 96-well plate.
    * Make sure to keep control wells without any cells to measure background
      luminescence.
2. Let cells divide for 72 hours.
3. Aspirate media using P10 tips to reduce suction of cells.
4. Add 50 μL of media to cells.
5. Add 50 μL of CellTitre-Glo reagent to cells.
6. Mix plate for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker to lyse cells.
7. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
8. Use plate reader to record luminescence of wells.
    * Use an integration time of .25 - 1 second per well.
