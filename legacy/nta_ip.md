# Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) Enrichment for IP elution

## Equipment

* Rotator

* Table-top Centrifuge

## Reagents

* Ni-NTA Superflow Ni-charged resin (Qiagen cat. no. 30410)
    * 25 mL is more than sufficient (200 μL per run)

* MilliQ Water

* 100 mM EDTA pH 8.9

* Iron Chloride ($FeCl_2$)
    * Located in fume hood in wet lab within desicator.

* 0.1% Trifluoroacetic Acid (TFA)

* 10% Trifluoroacetic Acid (TFA)
    * Use a glass pipette to aliquot a small amount into a glass vial.

* 0.1% Acetic Acid (AA)

* 250 mM Sodium Phosphate pH 8.9

## Steps

1. Aliquot 200 μL Ni-NTA slurry (100 μL resin) into a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube
   using a wide-tipped pipette.
2. Rinse beads 3x with 800 μL MilliQ Water.
    * For all rinses, spin at 6500 rpm for 1 minute.
    * Bead loss due to washes is acceptable and taken into account with the
      starting volume of beads.
3. Rinse beads 2x with 800 μL EDTA to strip away nickel.
    * Incubate samples for 15 minutes on rotator between each addition of EDTA
      and the spin-down step.
4. Rinse beads 3x with 800 μL MilliQ Water to remove excess EDTA.
5. Apply 800 μL of iron chloride solution to beads and incubate for 30 - 45
   minutes on rotator.
    * If running an IP, begin the final wash and elution steps immediately
      after adding iron to beads.
6. Wash beads 3x with 800 μL MilliQ Water to remove excess iron.
7. Wash beads 1x with 800 μL 0.1% TFA to acidify solution.
8. Resuspend beads in 50 μL 0.1% TFA.
9. Acidify pY IP elution (70 μL) with 10 μL 10% TFA.
10. Remove supernatant from IP elution and add to NTA beads.
11. Incubate for 30 - 60 minutes on rotator.
12. Spin down beads and save supernatant.
13. Wash beads 2x with 400 μL 0.1% TFA.
14. Wash beads 2x with 400 μL 0.1% AA.
15. Elute beads in 30 μL Sodium Phosphate pH 8.9.
16. Incubate for 30 minutes on rotator.
17. Load elution directly onto an acidified pre-column.
    * This loading step should take about 45 minutes.
18. Wash pre-column on bomb with 0.1% AA at 500 psi for 15 minutes to remove
    excess phosphate.
